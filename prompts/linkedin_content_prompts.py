    Am I Still a Developer or Just an AI Whisperer?

    "Vibe Coding" is taking off, and I had to see what the hype was about. What started as a casual experiment with AI for side projects has evolved into a full-blown shift in how I code. At first, I worriedâ€”was I becoming just an AI-dependent button pusher? But instead of making me rusty, Vibe Coding has sharpened my skills (though my typing speed has taken a hitâ€”small price to pay ðŸ˜…).

    At its core, software engineering has never been about typing speed or memorizing syntaxâ€”itâ€™s about solving problems. Vibe Coding eliminates the grunt work, allowing me to focus on business outcomes, architecture, design, and securityâ€”the aspects that truly define great software. Once you shift your mindset, the programming language becomes just another tool.

    Here is how Successfully Vibe Code Without Losing Your Developer Card:

    1. Experience First â€“ AI is great, but you still need to understand project structure, design patterns, security, and architecture. Without that foundation, you're just prompting and hoping for the best.

    2. Pick Your AI & Editor â€“ My setup? Cursor or VS Code + GitHub Copilotâ€”but find what works best for your flow.

    3. Master Prompting â€“ AI is only as effective as your instructions. Poor prompts lead to messy, inefficient code.

    3.Use the Right Model â€“ Different AI models excel in different areasâ€”know which ones work best for coding, debugging, and documentation.

    4. Define a Solid System Prompt â€“ AI tends to refactor unnecessarily. A well-crafted system prompt ensures clean, consistent code, reducing unwanted changes and maintaining structure.

    Sure, I type less, but I spend more time architecting and less time debugging. Vibe Coding isnâ€™t producing insecure, half-baked codeâ€”itâ€™s making good engineers more efficient and focused on high-impact work.
