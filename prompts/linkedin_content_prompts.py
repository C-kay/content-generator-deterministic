    Am I Still a Developer or Just an AI Whisperer?

    I started using AI to Vibe Code as an experiment. Now it's how I build.
    At first, I feared I was becoming a button pusher. But Vibe Coding didn't dull my skills‚Äîit sharpened them.
    (Though my typing speed took a hit üòÖ)

    Great engineering isn't about speed‚Äîit's about solving problems.
    AI now handles the grunt work, freeing me to focus on architecture, business goals, and secure design.

    How to Vibe Code Without Losing Your Dev Card:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Experience First - AI helps, but architecture wins.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Pick your stack - I use Cursor + GitHub Copilot.
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt with intent - Fuzzy prompts = fuzzy code.
    4Ô∏è‚É£ Use the right model - Match model to task.
    5Ô∏è‚É£ Set a system prompt - Keep code clean and consistent.

    I code less‚Äîbut build better.
