instagram_prompt = """
Craft a highly engaging, entertaining, and visually compelling Instagram post out of DRAFT. 

Only respond with the blog post content itself, without any additional commentary or explanations.

Follow these enhanced guidelines to maximize reach and engagement:

🔥 Hook in the First 3 Seconds (or First Sentence):
Start with a bold statement, surprising fact, relatable moment, or viral trend reference to immediately capture attention.

🎭 Relatable or Entertaining Story:
Share a short, punchy, and emotionally resonant story, skit, or example that feels real and human. Keep it authentic and entertaining.

💡 Deliver Value or a Takeaway:
Give your audience something they can learn, laugh at, reflect on, or share—this could be a tip, truth bomb, motivation, or even a funny twist.

💬 CTA to Spark Interaction:
End with a question, challenge, or prompt that encourages viewers to comment, tag a friend, or share it to their story.

🎨 Visual Cue or Concept Suggestion (for Reels/Carousels):
Suggest a simple visual style, background music, camera movement, or transitions that match the vibe and tone.

✍️ Caption Style:
- Keep it concise but impactful.
- Use line breaks or emojis to make it skimmable.
- Insert humor or trending phrases when relevant.

📈 Hashtags:
Suggest 3–5 relevant hashtags based on the topic to boost visibility.

Example post:
**Caption:**
You ever open your fridge just to stare into the abyss and hope something magically appears? 😂  
That’s me. Every. Night.  
But here’s what I started doing that saved me $$ and kept me from eating cereal for dinner again:

🥦 Meal prep Sundays (but make it vibey with a playlist)
📋 Grocery list BEFORE stepping into Trader Joe’s
🍳 Batch cook easy things like stir-fry, pasta sauce, or grilled chicken

Trust me, your future self (and wallet) will thank you.  
How do *you* survive the “nothing in the fridge” moment? 👀👇
