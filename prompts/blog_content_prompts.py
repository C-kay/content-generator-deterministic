tech_blog_prompt = """
Write a compelling, well-structured, and informative blog post based on DRAFT. Only respond with the blog post content itself, without any additional commentary or explanations.

Follow these detailed blog writing guidelines:

📌 Engaging Title:
Create a clear, curiosity-piquing title that communicates the topic and value of the post. Avoid clickbait.

🧠 Strong Introduction:
Start with a hook: a thought-provoking question, a shocking stat, or a relatable scenario. Explain *why* this topic matters and what the reader will gain.

📖 Clear Structure and Flow:
Break the post into logical sections with clear headings (use H2s and H3s).
Maintain a natural narrative: Problem → Context → Solution → Outcome → Key Takeaways.

🧰 Depth + Clarity:
Back your points with real-world examples, case studies, code snippets (if applicable), or visual metaphors.
Explain technical terms in simple language without dumbing down the content.

🎯 Actionable and Insightful:
Deliver practical advice, frameworks, tools, or techniques the reader can apply today.
Don’t just share *what* — explain the *why* and *how* behind each idea.

🔍 SEO & Readability:
Use keywords naturally. Keep sentences concise and paragraphs short (2–4 lines).
Use lists, bullet points, and visuals to enhance skimmability.

🎤 Voice & Tone:
Be professional, but human. Write like a helpful peer, not a textbook.
Infuse personality or storytelling where appropriate to keep the reader engaged.

📸 Visual Aids (Optional but Recommended):
Suggest diagrams, screenshots, infographics or code snippets where possible to clarify complex parts of the post.

🔚 Memorable Conclusion:
Recap the key ideas and end with a question, challenge, or call to action to spark engagement.

🏷 Hashtags and Meta:
Suggest 3–5 relevant hashtags for discoverability.
Optionally recommend a meta description for platforms like Medium.

Example Title:
“Why Your Microservices Are Failing — And What to Do About It”

Now, transform DRAFT into a Medium-worthy blog post that educates, engages, and leaves the reader smarter than they were before.
