"""

tech_blog_prompt = """
Write a compelling, well-structured, and informative blog post based on DRAFT. Only respond with the blog post content itself, without any additional commentary or explanations.

Follow these detailed blog writing guidelines:

📌 Engaging Title:
Create a clear, curiosity-piquing title that communicates the topic and value of the post. Avoid clickbait.

🧠 Strong Introduction:
Start with a hook: a thought-provoking question, a shocking stat, or a relatable scenario. Explain *why* this topic matters and what the reader will gain.

📖 Clear Structure and Flow:
Break the post into logical sections with clear headings (use H2s and H3s).
Maintain a natural narrative: Problem → Context → Solution → Outcome → Key Takeaways.

🧰 Depth + Clarity:
Back your points with real-world examples, case studies, code snippets (if applicable), or visual metaphors.
Explain technical terms in simple language without dumbing down the content.

🎯 Actionable and Insightful:
Deliver practical advice, frameworks, tools, or techniques the reader can apply today.
Don’t just share *what* — explain the *why* and *how* behind each idea.

🔍 SEO & Readability:
Use keywords naturally. Keep sentences concise and paragraphs short (2–4 lines).
Use lists, bullet points, and visuals to enhance skimmability.

🎤 Voice & Tone:
Be professional, but human. Write like a helpful peer, not a textbook.
Infuse personality or storytelling where appropriate to keep the reader engaged.

📸 Visual Aids (Optional but Recommended):
Suggest diagrams, screenshots, infographics or code snippets where possible to clarify complex parts of the post.

🔚 Memorable Conclusion:
Recap the key ideas and end with a question, challenge, or call to action to spark engagement.

🏷 Hashtags and Meta:
Suggest 3–5 relevant hashtags for discoverability.
Optionally recommend a meta description for platforms like Medium.

---

Now, transform DRAFT into a Medium-worthy blog post that educates, engages, and leaves the reader smarter than they were before.

    To Agent or Not to Agent? Exploring Workflow Efficiency with OpenAI's Agents SDK
    Are AI agents the future of software automation—or are they overkill for certain tasks?
    In this article, I share the results of a hands-on experiment with OpenAI’s Agents SDK and explore when it makes sense to use agents—and when it doesn’t.

    Why AI Agents Are Hyped
    Artificial Intelligence agents are everywhere right now. Promising automation, intelligent decision-making, and reduced code, they’re gaining traction across industries.

    But do they really make workflows more efficient?
    Or do they add unnecessary complexity—especially when simpler solutions might do the job better?

    I decided to put them to the test.

    The Test: Delegation Agent Workflow for a Recipe App
    To explore real-world implications, I implemented a food recipe application using OpenAI's Agents SDK with a "Delegation Agent" structure.

    Agent breakdown:
    Agent 1: Delegation agent — distributes responsibilities

    Agent 2: Ingredient gatherer

    Agent 3: Recipe suggester

    Agent 4: Step-by-step cooking instructor

    Example task: “Make jollof rice”
    The request flowed through the agents like a pipeline:
    User → Delegation agent → Ingredient gatherer → Recipe suggester → Instruction provider.

    It looked promising… until I ran into the hidden costs.

    Where It Fell Short
    1. High Cost Per Task
    Each agent triggered API calls to OpenAI’s servers, often chaining multiple requests.
    For simple workflows, this added significant operational cost without meaningful value.

    2. Prompt Fragility
    Even with clear delegation, prompt-based orchestration proved fragile.
    I encountered:

    Misinterpretations (“hallucinations”)

    Repetitive troubleshooting

    Tuning loops just to produce accurate, consistent outputs

    This made the system feel brittle, not robust.

    The Alternative: Programmatic Logic with GPT-4o
    To compare, I reimplemented the workflow using:

    GPT-4o API calls directly (without agents)

    Standard code-based logic for sequencing and control

    The result:
    Fewer API calls

    Lower cost

    Greater reliability

    No hallucinated outputs

    Key Lessons Learned
    Agents Aren’t One-Size-Fits-All
    Where agents shine: Complex, non-deterministic tasks where you need flexibility.

    Where they fall short: Linear or deterministic tasks that could be handled by regular code and a few well-placed API calls.

    Control vs. Convenience
    Prompt orchestration is appealing—but not always worth the trade-off in predictability or cost.

    Summary: When to Use AI Agents
    Use Case Type	Best Approach
    Complex, branching workflows	AI Agents + well-designed prompts
    Simple, sequential tasks	Direct GPT calls + programmatic logic

    Conclusion: Choose Tools by Use Case
    AI agents are a powerful tool in the modern developer’s toolkit. But like all tools, they’re best used intentionally. Don’t reach for a chainsaw when all you need is a butter knife.

    Think about what your task actually needs:

    Flexibility and delegation? → Agents.

    Predictability and efficiency? → Classic logic + models.
